HW1 NLP Classifier


### Describe the computing environment you used, especially if you used some off-the-shelf modules. (Do not use unusual packages. If youâ€™re not sure, please ask us.) 
* My code is written in Python, specifically python3. All of the packages I am using will be for Python3. There are few packages I am using but they are relatively well-known. In my code, I am using numpy, pandas, nltk, sklearn, scipy, collections, and math. Please ensure that these packages are installed before you run my code. To run, simply do "Python3 classifier.py" without the quotes.
* NOTE: Please ensure that you have nltk punkt installed. If not, my code will automatically download.

### List any additional resources, references, or web pages you've consulted.
* It is my first time using any Logistic Regression packages and as a result, I consulted a lot of sites that provide these documentations.
* Because I am new to using Logistic Regression packages, a lot of the how-to-use came from Stack Overflow. 
* In terms of refreshing my mind of what is and how to perform T-Test, I read an article explaining T-Test and how to calculate. [Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/inferential-statistics-series-t-test-using-numpy-2718f8f9bf2f)

### List any person with whom you've discussed the assignment and describe the nature of your discussions.
* I have talked to a friend named Zinan Zhuang. He is not currently enrolled in NLP but did an NLP research with a professor. He is familar with how to use Logistic Regression packages specifically from sklearn and was able to show me how to use it. 
* I have also contacted the Grading TA on some questions about the Logistic Regression packages as well from sklearn regarding about how to extract the weights and how to select other loss functions if there is an option.
* I have also talked to the professor in terms of the types of questions I should be asking, how to performing cross validations, and how to split data into trained set and test set.

### Discuss any unresolved issues or problems. 
* There are currently no known unresolved issues or problems that I am aware of.

### How to run:
* Please ensure that the packages I listed up above are installed on your machine. The code is written in Python3 so please run my code on a machine that has Python3. 
* please ensure that the SFU_constructiveness.csv is in the same directory as the Python3 code.
* To run, simply do "Python3 classifier.py" without the quotes.
* Please note that I have a lot of statstics being printed to screen. I recommend when running the code, print it to another file. I.E., Python3 classifier.py > Output.txt
